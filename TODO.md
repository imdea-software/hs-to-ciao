26/9

- TODO
  - [ ] schedule a meeting with the Ciao team for seeing what kind of resource analysis we want (and so they teach me how to use CiaoPP)
  - [ ] implement function to output Core bindings into a file
  - [ ] keep reading LYAH
  - [ ] one more example of manual translation
  - [ ] start translation pseudocode that works (at least) for these two examples
  - [x] update diagram with a user (which will be asking the analysis queries) and -fplugin=HsToCiaoPP 
  
19/9

- TODO
  - [x] keep reading LYAH (λ more applicatives, ~~monoids and monads!~~ λ)
      - applicatives turned out to be harder than expected to grasp in certain ways
  - [x] vector graphic for the "bigger picture"
  - [x] read about Core GHC
      - take a look at specialisations and try to understand how Core desugars
        typeclases
  - [x] plan for the example, manual translation
      - the plan is: code basic plain Haskell example (list reverse or similar),
        generate Core code, see how to translate into Prolog
  
12/9

- TODO
  - [X] keep reading LYAH
  - read about Core GHC 
    - [X] (actually watched Simon Peyton Jones' talks)
  - [ ] come up with an example and manual translation
  - [X] sketch the bigger picture of where we're trying to get (resource analysis of Haskell source)

5/9

- TODO
  - [x] create a .pdf with the goals and challenges of with work 
  - [x] start book readings 
  - [ ] fix the prolog grammar (on paper and on the implementation)
