IN THE FUTURE:

- [ ] Make the 3 manual examples work with CiaoPP analysis

24/10

- TODO
  - [ ] keep reading LYAH/Graham
  - [ ] migrate previous manual translations to Ciao's functional syntax
  - [x] check if the manual translation for map-reduce is correct
    - [x] fix my Ciao/CiaoPP installation
  - [ ] more concrete pseudocode
    - [ ] get cleaner print bindings (mess with the current code)

10/10

- TODO
  - [x] keep reading LYAH
  - [x] write the report for my university
  - [x] check out the Programming with Higher-Order Logic book
  - [ ] try to install CiaoPP
    - [x] try to read CiaoPP manual
      - ↑ met with Maximiliano last week and he explained the basics of code analysis
  - [ ] manual translation for map-reduce
  - [ ] print bindings in a more explicit manner (mess with the current code)

3/10

- TODO
  - [x] one more example of manual translation
    - [x] start translation pseudocode that works (at least) for these two examples
  - [x] keep reading LYAH
  - [x] read the paper on higher order programming Prolog
  - [ ] try to read CiaoPP manual

26/9

- TODO
  - [ ] schedule a meeting with the Ciao team for seeing what kind of resource analysis we want (and so they teach me how to use CiaoPP)
    - I didn't get a reply :(
  - [x] implement function to output Core bindings into a file
  - [x] keep reading LYAH
  - [ ] one more example of manual translation
    - ↑ had a bit of trouble with this one
    - [ ] start translation pseudocode that works (at least) for these two examples
  - [x] update diagram with a user (which will be asking the analysis queries) and -fplugin=HsToCiaoPP 
  
19/9

- TODO
  - [x] keep reading LYAH (λ more applicatives, ~~monoids and monads!~~ λ)
      - applicatives turned out to be harder than expected to grasp in certain ways
  - [x] vector graphic for the "bigger picture"
  - [x] read about Core GHC
      - take a look at specialisations and try to understand how Core desugars
        typeclases
  - [x] plan for the example, manual translation
      - the plan is: code basic plain Haskell example (list reverse or similar),
        generate Core code, see how to translate into Prolog
  
12/9

- TODO
  - [X] keep reading LYAH
  - read about Core GHC 
    - [X] (actually watched Simon Peyton Jones' talks)
  - [ ] come up with an example and manual translation
  - [X] sketch the bigger picture of where we're trying to get (resource analysis of Haskell source)

5/9

- TODO
  - [x] create a .pdf with the goals and challenges of with work 
  - [x] start book readings 
  - [ ] fix the prolog grammar (on paper and on the implementation)
  - [x] started reading a bit about Core

- DONE 
  - [x] summer
